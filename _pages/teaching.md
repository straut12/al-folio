For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like!

* Low side is idle and high side is using programs.  Numbers are estimated.  
When working on a solar or battery project need to measure the power usage for that  
specific pi setup.  Watts (Power) = I (currrent A) x V (voltage)

Notes for RPi4
- has dual display ports (having 2 screens is nice for working on projects)
- requires larger power supply and type-C charging cord.
